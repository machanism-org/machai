/*-
 * @guidance:
 *
 * **IMPORTANT: UPDATE THIS `package-info.java`!**
 *
 * - Use Clear and Concise Descriptions:
 *     - Write meaningful summaries that explain the purpose, behavior, and usage of the package and its elements.
 *     - Avoid vague statements; be specific about functionality and intent.
 *
 * - Update `package-info.java`:
 *     - Generate comprehensive package-level Javadoc that clearly describes the package’s overall purpose, scope, and usage based on package-info.java files located on child folders.
 *     - Place the package-level Javadoc immediately before the `package` declaration.
 *
 *     - When generating Javadoc, if you encounter code blocks inside `<pre>` tags, escape `<` and `>` as `&lt;` and &gt; in `<pre>` content for Javadoc. 
 *        Ensure that the code is properly escaped and formatted.
