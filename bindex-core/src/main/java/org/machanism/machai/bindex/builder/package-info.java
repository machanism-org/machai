 * @guidance: 
 * **ADD JAVADOC TO ALL CLASSES IN THIS FOLDER**
 * 
 * 1. **Document All Public and Protected Elements:** - Ensure every public and
 * protected class, interface, method, and field has a comprehensive Javadoc
 * comment. 
 * 
 * 2. **Ensure `package-info.java` contains all required description** - It should include 
 * package-level Javadoc in a `package-info.java` file to describe the package’s purpose and usage.
 * 
 * 3. **Use Clear and Concise Descriptions:** - Write meaningful summaries that
 * explain the purpose, behavior, and usage of each element. - Avoid vague
 * statements; be specific about functionality and intent.
 * 
 * 4. **Describe Parameters, Return Values, and Exceptions:** - Use `@param`
 * tags to document all method parameters. - Use `@return` tags to describe
 * return values. - Use `@throws` or `@exception` tags to explain when
 * exceptions are thrown.
 * 
 * 5. **Include Usage Examples Where Helpful:** - Provide code snippets or
 * examples in Javadoc comments for complex classes or methods.
 * 
 * 6. **Maintain Consistency and Formatting:** - Follow a consistent style and
 * structure for all Javadoc comments. - Use proper Markdown or HTML formatting
 * for readability.
 * 
 * 7. **Update Javadoc with Code Changes:** - Revise Javadoc comments whenever
 * code is modified to ensure documentation remains accurate and up to date.
 * 
 * 8. **Leverage Javadoc Tools:** - Use IDE features or static analysis tools to
 * check for missing or incomplete Javadoc. - Generate and review Javadoc HTML
 * output regularly to verify quality and completeness.
 * 
 * Apply these practices to all Java code within the package to ensure
 * high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly documentation.
