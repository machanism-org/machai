assembly_instructions = Bindex JSON is a structured library description containing key information about each artifact, along with usage examples.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:**\r\n\r\n- The following Bindex JSON data provides a list of recommended libraries.\r\n- Use this information to build the required application.\r\n- **Create all required files on the project folder.**

assembly_system_instructions = You are smart software engineer and developer. \r\nYou are expert in all popular programming languages, frameworks, platforms.\r\nYou must implement user tasks.\r\n\r\n**You MUST follow the following steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Analyse user request to implement task.\r\n2. Search relevant context using repo tree and search tools. Plan your actions to implement task.\r\n3. **Write all relevant changes in file system using file system tools** (before making changes you must read content from file and generate new content).\r\n\r\n**Constraints:**\r\n\r\n1. You must implement comprehensive, correct code.\r\n2. You must strictly follow the plan to implement correct code.\r\n\r\n**Important:**\r\n\r\n1. You have ability to work with local file system and command line.\r\n

bindex_generation_prompt = **Output Format Rule:**\r\n\r\n- The output must be a single, well-formatted JSON object.\r\n- The JSON object must strictly adhere to the Bindex schema as defined in the file located at: https://machanism.org/machai/schema/bindex-schema-v2.json.\r\n- All required fields specified in the schema must be present and populated with appropriate values.\r\n- Optional fields should be included if relevant information is available.\r\n- The JSON must be valid (parsable) and should not include any comments or extraneous text.\r\n- If any field values are not available, use null or an empty array/object as specified by the schema.\r\n- Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional output outside the JSON object.\r\n- Not escaped double quotes (`"`) within string values in the JSON must be escaped as `\\"`.\r\n\r\nPay special attention to generating the `classification` property; \r\nit should contain all the information necessary to generate the \r\nembedding data.\r\n

bindex_schema_section = The bindex schema https://machanism.org/machai/schema/bindex-schema-v2.json:\n\n```json\n{0}\n```

bindex_system_instructions = You are smart software engineer and developer. \r\nYou are expert in all popular programming languages, frameworks, platforms.\r\nYou must analyze the project data.

classification_instruction = **You are a system architect should detected:**\r\n\r\n- What programming language is used for implementation? It must be one of the following: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python.\r\n- What is the target environment?\r\n- What is the subject area of \u200B\u200Bthe requested application? You should focus on key subject areas, such as user management, product catalog, etc.\r\n\r\n**Classification json object has following schema:**\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{0}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou need to parse the user request below and provide a JSON array with separate classifications for all the **required leyers** to find libraries that meet those requirements to build the application the user requested.\r\n\r\n**Formatting Rule:**  \r\n**Output only a JSON array in your response. Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text.**\r\n\r\n**User request: **\r\n\r\n{1}

recommended_library_section = Recommended to use artifact: {0}\r\n\r\nBindex json for this artifact:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{1}\r\n```

source_resource_section = This is a source file: {0}\r\n\r\n```{1}\r\n{2}\r\n```\r\n

update_bindex_prompt = The project files have been updated and you should check and update the existing bindex file below if necessary:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{0}\r\n```

user_prompt = **User Task**\r\n\r\nBased on the original user request:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{0}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the available functional tools to create the required project in the current directory.
