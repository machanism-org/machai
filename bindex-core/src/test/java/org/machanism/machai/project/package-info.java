 * <ul>
 *   <li>Core logic, edge cases, and error handling</li>
 *   <li>AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) methodology</li>
 *   <li>Dependency isolation/mocking as needed</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each test class and method is well-documented to support maintainable, readable coverage of package functionality.
 * Tests are intended for execution in typical Java build environments using JUnit, Mockito, and related libraries as required.
 * 
 * @see org.machanism.machai.project.ProjectLayoutManager
 * @see org.machanism.machai.project.ProjectProcessor
 *
 * @guidance:
 * Create high-quality unit tests in this folder for all public and package-private classes and methods in the package org.machanism.machai.project.
 * The source files are located in [Project Path]/src/main/java/org/machanism/machai/project.
 * - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all core logic, edge cases, and error handling.
 * - Use descriptive test method names and meaningful assertions.
 * - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) structure in each test.
