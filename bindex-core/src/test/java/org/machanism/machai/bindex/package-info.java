 * @guidance: Create high-quality unit tests in this folder for all public and package-private classes
 * and methods in the package org.machanism.macha.core.commons.configurator.
 * The source files are located in src/main/java/org/machanism/machai/bindex.
 *
 * Guidelines:
 * - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all core logic, edge cases, and error handling.
 * - Use descriptive test method names and meaningful assertions.
 * - Follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) structure in each test.
 * - Mock dependencies where appropriate to isolate units under test.
 * - Place test files in this directory, mirroring the package structure of the source files.
