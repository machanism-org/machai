# Machai

## Overview

Machai is a core component of the [Machanism](https://machanism.org) platform designed to automate the assembly of customer applications. It leverages GenAI to generate and utilize `bindex.json` metadata for intelligent library selection and integration using semantic search. The primary goal of Machai is to streamline application builds by enabling AI-driven decision-making and automating repetitive development tasks.

## Key Idea

The core idea behind Machai is to enable AI-assisted project assembly for the Machanism ecosystem. Each library in the platform is accompanied by a `bindex.json` file, a structured metadata file that describes the library’s features, integration points, and example usage. These files are stored and indexed in a vector database to facilitate semantic search and retrieval of relevant libraries for application assembly. By analyzing customer application requirements through a natural language query, Machai helps developers quickly identify and integrate libraries that align with their needs.

## Implementation Details

### 1. `bindex.json` File
- **Purpose**: The `bindex.json` file is central to the functionality of Machai. It acts as a descriptor file containing detailed information about each library in the Machanism platform, focusing on its technical features, examples, and integration points.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Metadata**: Includes name, version, ID, description, tags, author information, and license details.
  - **Integration Details**: Provides technical details on how the library can be integrated, including its features, tech stack, and customizations.
  - **Semantic Search**: The `description` parameter in the file is optimized for embedding generation, allowing the search engine to perform intelligent semantic matching based on user intent.

### 2. Semantic Search and Library Retrieval
- A vector database stores all `bindex.json` objects, indexing their meaningful content using AI-generated embeddings.
- When developers input their application requirements, Machai uses GenAI to:
  1. Parse the natural language query.
  2. Generate a query embedding.
  3. Perform semantic search in the vector database to identify relevant libraries.
- **Outcome**: Developers receive a report containing all relevant `bindex.json` metadata and suggested libraries that match their application's requirements.

## How It Works

1. **Library Metadata Creation**:  
   For every library on the Machanism platform, a `bindex.json` file is automatically generated by analyzing project artifacts such as `pom.xml`, code files, and other metadata using GenAI.

2. **Vector Database Storage**:  
   The `bindex.json` file is indexed in a vector database. This enables efficient semantic search, allowing libraries to be retrieved based on high-level user queries.

3. **Application Assembly Workflow**:
   - Developers input their project requirements as natural language queries through the Machanism platform.
   - GenAI takes the input, generates a semantic representation, and searches the vector database for relevant libraries.
   - A detailed report of potential libraries and their integration points is provided, making application assembly seamless and efficient.
