# Machai

Machai is an innovative project designed to harness Generative AI (GenAI) for the creation, registration, and enhancement of software projects within the [Machanism](https://machanism.org) ecosystem. With Machai, teams can streamline project assembly, automate repetitive tasks, and continuously improve their applications through intelligent recommendations and metadata-driven insights. Whether you are building new solutions or enhancing existing ones, Machai provides the tools and automation needed to accelerate development and ensure high-quality results.

Machai streamlines project assembly by automating repetitive development tasks through AI assistance. Each library on the platform is accompanied by a structured metadata file, `bindex.json`, which contains essential details such as features, integration points, technology stack, and usage examples.

These metadata files are stored in a **vector database** and optimized for semantic search, enabling Machai to efficiently match libraries to natural language queries. Developers can specify their project requirements in plain language, and Machai recommends suitable libraries along with comprehensive integration information, accelerating application assembly and development.

## Machai CLI

The **Machai Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a powerful tool for generating, registering, and managing library metadata within the [Machanism](https://machanism.org) platform. It gives developers direct access to Machai’s AI-powered features, streamlining project assembly and integration workflows from the terminal.

**Key Features:**
- **Automated Metadata Generation:** Analyze project files and source code to create structured `bindex.json` metadata files.
- **Semantic Search Integration:** Use AI to match libraries with project requirements via natural language queries.
- **Library Registration:** Register new or updated libraries, making them discoverable and ready for integration.
- **Flexible Command Set:** Generate metadata, search libraries, register artifacts, and more.
