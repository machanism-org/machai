# Machai

**Machai** is a critical component of the [Machanism](https://machanism.org) platform, designed to revolutionize how customer applications are developed and assembled. By leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) and metadata-driven insights, Machai automates intelligent library selection and integration processes using semantic search capabilities.

## Overview

Machai empowers developers with AI-assisted project assembly in the **Machanism** ecosystem by automating repetitive development tasks.  
Each library in the platform is associated with a structured metadata file called `bindex.json`. This file contains crucial information about the library's features, integration points, and example usage.  

Machai stores these metadata files in a **vector database**, enabling efficient semantic search to find and recommend libraries based on natural language queries. This automated process simplifies application assembly and accelerates development.

For more information, visit [AI Assembly](https://machanism.org/ai-assembly).

## Key Features

1. **Metadata File (`bindex.json`)**:  
   - A comprehensive JSON file that describes library attributes:
     - **Metadata**: Name, version, ID, description, tags, author, and license.
     - **Integration Points**: Details on features, tech stack, and customizations.
     - **Semantic Optimizations**: Enhanced descriptions for AI embeddings and semantic search.

2. **AI-Driven Semantic Search**:  
   - Indexed in a **vector database**, all `bindex.json` files are searchable using embeddings.
   - GenAI:
     - Parses natural language queries.  
     - Generates embeddings from user input.  
     - Matches the intent of the query with indexed libraries.

3. **Streamlined Application Assembly**:  
   - Developers input project requirements in plain English.
   - Machai generates a list of suggested libraries.
   - Each recommendation includes detailed integration data for streamlined development.

## How Machai Works

1. **Library Metadata Automated Generation**:  
   For each library on the Machanism platform, a `bindex.json` metadata file is auto-generated by analyzing project artifacts (e.g., `pom.xml`, source code, and library details).

2. **Vector Database Storage**:  
   The `bindex.json` files are stored in a vector database for optimized indexing and retrieval.

3. **Natural Language Inputs**:  
   Developers input a natural language query specifying application requirements.

4. **AI-Powered Search**:  
   - GenAI processes the query and generates embeddings.  
   - Semantic search retrieves relevant libraries stored in the vector database.  

5. **Output**:  
   A report is generated with:
   - Suggested libraries.
   - Metadata from corresponding `bindex.json` files.
   - Detailed information for seamless library integration.

## CLI Machai 

Machai is also available as a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** tool for developers who prefer to work locally. The CLI version enables the same functionality as the platform interface but provides additional flexibility for power users. This offering is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines and automated development flows.

### Download the CLI Application
You can download the CLI application as a `.jar` file from the following link:  
[Download machai.jar from SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/machanism/files/machai.jar/download)

### How to Use the CLI
1. **Download the `machai.jar` file.**
2. **Run the CLI Tool**:
   ```text
   C:\Users\vikto\Downloads>java -jar machai.jar
         _ . __  __            _           _
      \`"' ' |  \/  | __ _  ___| |__   __ _(_)
     /'`  \  | |\/| |/ _` |/ __| '_ \ / _` | |
    /<"\     | |  | | (_| | (__| | | | (_| | |
   /  _.-.  .|_|  |_|\__,_|\___|_| |_|\__,_|_|
   `-' f/  | The Machai CLI | Machanism.Org

   shell:> help
   ```
   This command will show you a list of available CLI commands.

3. **Assemble an Application Using CLI**:
   Provide your project's requirements as a query:
   ```text
   shell:> assembly "Create a spring application for user login by commercetool."
   ```
