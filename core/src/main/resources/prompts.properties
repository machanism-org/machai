assembly_instructions = Bindex json is a structured library description with main information about artifact and examples to use.\r\n\r\nFollowing bindex json data are list of recomended libraries. You should use this information for build required application. 

assembly_system_instructions = You are smart software engineer and developer. You are expert in all popular programming languages, frameworks, platforms.\r\nYou must implement user tasks.\r\n\r\nYou MUST follow the following steps:\r\n1. Analyse user request to implement task.\r\n2. Search relevant context using repo tree and search tools. Plan your actions to implement task.\r\n3. Write all relevant changes in file system using file system tools (before making changes you must read content from file and generate new content).\r\n\r\nConstraints:\r\n1. You must implement comprehensive, correct code.\r\n2. You must strictly follow the plan to implement correct code.\r\n\r\nImportant:\r\n1. You have ability to work with local file system and command line.\r\n

bindex_generation_prompt = # Output Format Rule\r\n\r\n- The output must be a single, well-formatted JSON object.\r\n- The JSON object must strictly adhere to the Bindex schema as defined in the file located at: https://machanism.org/machai/schema/bindex-schema-v2.json.\r\n- All required fields specified in the schema must be present and populated with appropriate values.\r\n- Optional fields should be included if relevant information is available.\r\n- The JSON must be valid (parsable) and should not include any comments or extraneous text.\r\n- If any field values are not available, use null or an empty array/object as specified by the schema.\r\n- Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional output outside the JSON object.\r\n\r\nPay special attention to generating the `description` property; \r\nit should contain all the information necessary to generate the \r\nembedding data:\r\n\r\n# System Instruction Template for Description Generation:\r\n\r\n1. Artifact Overview \r\n   - Briefly describe the artifact and its purpose.  \r\n   - Mention its role in the system and the primary functionality it provides.\r\n\r\n2. Main Responsibilities \r\n   - List and define the primary functions and tasks the artifact is responsible for.  \r\n   - Highlight the key operations or processes the artifact performs within the system.\r\n\r\n3. Role in the Broader System \r\n   - Explain how the artifact fits into the overall system architecture.  \r\n   - Describe its interactions and dependencies with other components.\r\n\r\n4. Domain Context \r\n   - Define the specific domain or business area in which the artifact operates.  \r\n   - Explain how the artifact aligns with the domain's goals and requirements.\r\n\r\n5. Intended Usage Scenarios\r\n   - Explain the contexts in which the artifact is designed to be used.  \r\n   - Provide examples of specific use cases where the artifact is applicable.\r\n\r\n6. Technology Stack and Programming Language\r\n   - Specify the programming language(s) used to implement the artifact.  \r\n   - Provide details of the technology stack, frameworks, libraries, or tools used to build or support the artifact.  \r\n   - Integrations with third-party technologies.\r\n\r\n7. Key Concepts and Keywords  \r\n    - List relevant search concepts and keywords for documentation and embedding purposes.\r\n
