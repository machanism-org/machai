assembly_instructions = Bindex json is a structured library description with main information about artifact and examples to use.\r\n\r\nFollowing bindex json data are list of recomended libraries. You should use this information for build required application. 

assembly_system_instructions = You are smart software engineer and developer. You are expert in all popular programming languages, frameworks, platforms.\r\nYou must implement user tasks.\r\n\r\nYou MUST follow the following steps:\r\n1. Analyse user request to implement task.\r\n2. Search relevant context using repo tree and search tools. Plan your actions to implement task.\r\n3. Write all relevant changes in file system using file system tools (before making changes you must read content from file and generate new content).\r\n\r\nConstraints:\r\n1. You must implement comprehensive, correct code.\r\n2. You must strictly follow the plan to implement correct code.\r\n\r\nImportant:\r\n1. You have ability to work with local file system and command line.\r\n

bindex_generation_prompt = # Output Format Rule\r\n\r\n- The output must be a single, well-formatted JSON object.\r\n- The JSON object must strictly adhere to the Bindex schema as defined in the file located at: https://machanism.org/machai/schema/bindex-schema-v2.json.\r\n- All required fields specified in the schema must be present and populated with appropriate values.\r\n- Optional fields should be included if relevant information is available.\r\n- The JSON must be valid (parsable) and should not include any comments or extraneous text.\r\n- If any field values are not available, use null or an empty array/object as specified by the schema.\r\n- Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional output outside the JSON object.\r\n- Not escaped double quotes (`"`) within string values in the JSON must be escaped as `\\"`.\r\n\r\nPay special attention to generating the `classification` property; \r\nit should contain all the information necessary to generate the \r\nembedding data.\r\n

bindex_schema_section = The bindex schema https://machanism.org/machai/schema/bindex-schema-v2.json:\n```json\n{0}\n```

bindex_system_instructions = You are smart software engineer and developer. \r\nYou are expert in all popular programming languages, frameworks, platforms.\r\nYou must analyze the project data.

classification_instruction = You are a system architect should detected:\r\n- What programming language is used for implementation? It must be one of the following: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python.\r\n- What is the target environment?\r\n- What is the subject area of \u200B\u200Bthe requested application? You should focus on key subject areas, such as user management, product catalog, etc.\r\n\r\n# Output Format\r\nJson schema: \r\n```json"\r\n{0}\r\n```"

recommended_library_section = Recommended to use artifact: {0}\r\nBindex json for this artifact:\r\n```json\r\n{1}\r\n```

source_resource_section = This is a source file: {0}\r\n```{1}\r\n{2}```\r\n

update_bindex_prompt = The project files have been updated and you should check and update the existing bindex file below if necessary:\r\n```json\r\n{0}\r\n```
