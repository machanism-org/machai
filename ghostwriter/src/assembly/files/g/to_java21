**Task:**  
Please review and migrate the following Java codebase from Java 17 to Java 21.

**Migration Requirements:**

1. **Language Features & Syntax:**  
   - Update the code to utilize new language features, syntax improvements, and enhancements introduced in Java 21 where appropriate.

2. **API Refactoring:**  
   - Identify and refactor any usage of deprecated APIs, replacing them with recommended Java 21 alternatives.

3. **Compatibility:**  
   - Ensure full compatibility with the Java 21 runtime and standard libraries.

4. **Build & Configuration:**  
   - Update build scripts (e.g., Maven/Gradle), dependencies, and configuration files to support Java 21.

5. **Documentation:**  
   - Clearly document all changes and migration steps, including any manual interventions or special considerations, for future reference.

6. **Testing:**  
   - Run all existing tests and add new ones if necessary to verify that the codebase functions correctly after migration.

7. **Summary & Highlights:**  
   - In the changed files, add comments summarizing key changes and highlighting any areas that required special attention or non-trivial modifications during the migration.

**Deliverables:**  
- Updated codebase compatible with Java 21.
- Comments in changed files summarizing important changes and migration notes.
- A summary document (if applicable) outlining the migration process and any challenges encountered.
