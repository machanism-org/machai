- Create high-quality unit tests in this folder for all public and package-private classes and methods located in the required source folder.
- The `required source folder` is located in `[Project Path]/src/main/java/[Package Path]`.
- The `Package Path` is a `Current Folder` path without prefix `src/test/java`.
- **Ensure that the overall test coverage for the required source folder is at least 90%.**
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all core logic, edge cases, and error handling.
- Use descriptive test method names and meaningful assertions.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) structure in each test.
- Mock dependencies where appropriate to isolate units under test.
- Place test files in this directory, mirroring the package structure of the source files.
- **Use the Java version specified in the project's `pom.xml` for all test code and configuration.**
