Welcome to **Ghostwriter**, a platform for document automation and intelligent code generation.

## Project Overview
Ghostwriter provides a structured foundation for building and maintaining automated documentation and code generation workflows. It is intended to integrate cleanly into Maven-based builds and developer toolchains.

## Main Features
- Document creation, conversion, and formatting automation
- Template-driven generation to support consistent outputs
- Integration points suitable for enterprise tools and workflows
- Organization aligned with standard Maven source/resource/test layouts
- Extensible design for adding new generators and formats

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project with Maven:
   - `mvn clean install`
3. Generate the project site:
   - `mvn site`
4. Review the generated site output and expand the templates and generators as needed.

## Goals
- Improve productivity through repeatable automation
- Increase consistency and quality of generated artifacts
- Support scalable, maintainable, document-driven development
