**IMPORTANT: GENERATE CONTENT FOR THIS FILE: `overview.html` ACCORDING TO THE BEST PRACTICES AND RULES BELOW.**

Ghostwriter supports **all types of project files—including source code, documentation, project site content, and other relevant files**.

- **Write Clear and Concise Descriptions:**
	- Follow best practices for creating a package overview.
    - Provide meaningful summaries that clearly explain the purpose, behavior, and usage of each element.
    - Avoid vague or generic statements; be specific about functionality and intent.
    - Aggregate information from `package-info.java` files from source folders.
    - Use the class diagram located at `../images/class-diagram.png`.
    - Create a detailed package-level overview that describes its overall purpose, structure, and usage.

  <h1>Ghostwriter</h1>
  <p>
    Ghostwriter is a command-line utility that scans a project’s filesystem, extracts embedded
    <code>@guidance:</code> directives from supported file formats, and orchestrates GenAI-driven updates.
    The tool is intentionally <strong>filesystem-based</strong>: it does not compile sources, execute builds,
    or resolve dependencies.
  </p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
  <p>
    Ghostwriter turns in-repository guidance (for example, <code>@guidance:</code> comments in source,
    documentation, and site content) into provider-ready prompts that can be used to update project files.
    Its scan-and-review model is designed to work across the full set of files that commonly make up a project:
    source code, documentation, project site content, and other relevant artifacts.
  </p>

  <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <figcaption>High-level class relationships in the Ghostwriter processing pipeline.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The implementation is organized into two cooperating packages:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong><code>org.machanism.machai.gw.processor</code></strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Command-line entry point and processing pipeline responsible for filesystem traversal, prompt composition,
      and provider orchestration.
      The processor walks a project tree, applies include/exclude rules, extracts guidance via reviewers,
      and submits the composed prompt to a configured GenAI provider.
      In multi-module layouts, modules are processed <strong>child-first</strong> (each module is scanned before
      the parent directory).
    </dd>

    <dt><strong><code>org.machanism.machai.gw.reviewer</code></strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Reviewer service-provider interface (SPI) and format-specific implementations used to extract and
      normalize guidance from project files.
      Reviewers understand comment conventions for a specific format, find <code>@guidance:</code> blocks,
      and return normalized guidance fragments for downstream prompt composition.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Processing model</h2>

  <h3>Filesystem-first scanning</h3>
  <p>
    Ghostwriter operates directly on files and directories. It does not compile the project, execute builds,
    or resolve dependencies; the guidance pipeline is based on file content and project layout only.
  </p>

  <h3>Module traversal</h3>
  <p>
    When a project layout declares modules, Ghostwriter processes modules before their parent directory
    (child-first). This helps ensure module-local guidance is discovered and applied before parent-level guidance.
  </p>

  <h3>Scan targeting</h3>
  <p>
    A scan target can be a directory path or a matcher expression supported by
    <code>java.nio.file.FileSystems.getPathMatcher</code>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Directory path (typically relative to the project root)</li>
    <li><code>glob:</code> patterns (for example, <code>glob:**/*.java</code>)</li>
    <li><code>regex:</code> patterns (for example, <code>regex:^.*/[^/]+\\.java$</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance extraction and orchestration</h3>
  <p>
    For each selected file, Ghostwriter delegates guidance extraction to a matching reviewer.
    The extracted guidance is normalized (including project-relative path context) and combined with project
    context to form a provider-ready prompt.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Packages</h2>

  <h3><code>org.machanism.machai.gw.processor</code></h3>
  <p>
    Contains the user-facing CLI and the processing pipeline that turns scanned files into GenAI provider calls.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Filesystem traversal</strong>: walk the project tree, support include matchers
      (<code>glob:</code>/<code>regex:</code>), and apply exclusion rules.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Provider orchestration</strong>: create and configure a provider, apply any configured function tools,
      and optionally log composed prompt inputs for traceability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guidance processing</strong>: select reviewers by file extension, extract embedded guidance, compose
      prompts, and dispatch them to the provider.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><code>org.machanism.machai.gw.reviewer</code></h3>
  <p>
    Defines the <code>Reviewer</code> SPI and contains implementations responsible for extracting embedded
    <code>@guidance</code> directives from different file formats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reviewers commonly cover both code and documentation formats, such as Java source (including
    <code>package-info.java</code>), Markdown, HTML/XML, TypeScript, Python, PlantUML, and plain text guidance files.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Typical usage</h2>
  <pre><code>java -jar gw.jar &lt;scanTarget&gt; [options]</code></pre>
  <p>
    The <code>&lt;scanTarget&gt;</code> argument can be a relative directory path or a matcher expression supported by
    <code>java.nio.file.FileSystems.getPathMatcher</code>.
  </p>
