@guidance:
**IMPORTANT: GENERATE CONTENT FOR THIS FILE: `overview.html` ACCORDING TO THE BEST PRACTICES AND RULES BELOW.**

Use information from `pom.xml` for get information about PROJECT_NAME: `project.name`, PROJECT_DESCRIPTION: `project.description`.
[PROJECT_NAME] supports all types of project files—including source code, documentation, project site content, and other relevant files.

- **Write Clear and Concise Descriptions:**
    - Follow best practices for creating a package overview.
    - Provide meaningful summaries that clearly explain the purpose, behavior, and usage of each element.
    - Avoid vague or generic statements; be specific about functionality and intent.
    - Aggregate information from `package-info.java` files from source folders.
    - Use the class diagram located at `../images/class-diagram.png`.
    - Create a detailed package-level overview that describes its overall purpose, structure, and usage.

- **Automatic Fixes for Javadoc Build Issues:**
    - If Javadoc build fails due to invalid @throws tags or missing required Javadoc, 
       automatically correct these issues in the generated `overview.html` content (e.g., omit invalid tags, add missing descriptions as needed).

  <title>Ghostwriter Overview</title>

<header>
  <h1>Ghostwriter</h1>
  <p>
    Ghostwriter is an advanced documentation engine that automatically scans, analyzes, and assembles project
    documentation using embedded guidance tags and AI-powered synthesis.
    It operates as a filesystem-first command-line utility and supports all types of project files7including
    source code, documentation, project site content, and other relevant files.
  </p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Purpose and scope</h2>
  <p>
    Ghostwriter walks a project directory tree, discovers embedded <code>@guidance:</code> instructions, and
    orchestrates the creation of provider-ready prompts for a configured GenAI provider.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Filesystem-only processing</strong>: scanning does not compile code and does not resolve dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Child-first traversal</strong>: when module directories are present, they are processed before the parent.</li>
    <li><strong>Format-aware extraction</strong>: guidance is extracted by file-type reviewers (for example Java, Markdown, and HTML).</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key concepts</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Guidance</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      A mandatory <code>@guidance:</code> block embedded in a file comment. Guidance is treated as file-scoped instructions
      that can be extracted and included in a prompt.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Reviewer</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      A file-format-aware scanner that locates and extracts <code>@guidance:</code> blocks according to the comment
      conventions of a specific format.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Processor pipeline</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      The orchestration layer that traverses the filesystem, selects a reviewer per file, composes prompts from guidance
      and project context, and dispatches the prompts to the configured GenAI provider.
    </dd>
  </dl>

    <figcaption>High-level class relationships in the Ghostwriter processing pipeline.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Ghostwriter is organized into two primary packages: the processing pipeline and the reviewer SPI with
    format-specific implementations.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Package overview</h2>

  <h3><code>org.machanism.machai.gw.processor</code></h3>
  <p>
    Project scanning and prompt orchestration for the Ghostwriter command-line tool.
    The processors in this package implement a filesystem-based pipeline that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>traverses a project directory tree (including multi-module layouts),</li>
    <li>selects scan targets via explicit directories or <code>glob:</code>/<code>regex:</code> matchers,</li>
    <li>extracts embedded <code>@guidance:</code> directives via extension-specific reviewers, and</li>
    <li>builds and dispatches prompts to a configured GenAI provider.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Processing operates strictly on the filesystem: projects are not built and dependencies are not resolved during scanning.
    When module directories are present, they are processed child-first so that module content can be handled before
    any parent-level aggregation.
  </p>

  <h3><code>org.machanism.machai.gw.reviewer</code></h3>
  <p>
    File-format-aware scanners used by Ghostwriter to discover embedded <code>@guidance</code> instructions.
    This package defines the reviewer SPI and includes concrete implementations for common project artifacts such as Java,
    TypeScript, Python, Markdown, HTML/XML, PlantUML, and plain-text files.
  </p>
  <p>
    A reviewer inspects an individual file, detects whether it contains the guidance tag, and if present produces a
    normalized prompt fragment (typically including the project-relative file path and relevant content) for
    consumption by the processing pipeline.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Processing model</h2>

  <h3>Scan targets and matchers</h3>
  <p>
    A scan target can be a directory path (typically relative to the project root) or a matcher expression supported by
    <code>java.nio.file.FileSystems.getPathMatcher</code>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Directory path (for example, <code>src/main</code>)</li>
    <li><code>glob:</code> patterns (for example, <code>glob:**/*.java</code>)</li>
    <li><code>regex:</code> patterns (for example, <code>regex:^.*/[^/]+\\.java$</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Guidance extraction and orchestration</h3>
  <p>
    For each selected file, Ghostwriter chooses an appropriate reviewer based on the file format, extracts any embedded
    guidance blocks, and combines them with project context (such as the project-relative file path and relevant content)
    to build a provider-ready prompt.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Typical usage</h2>
  <pre><code>java -jar gw.jar &lt;scanTarget&gt; [options]</code></pre>
  <p>
    The <code>&lt;scanTarget&gt;</code> argument can be a relative directory path or a matcher expression supported by
    <code>java.nio.file.FileSystems.getPathMatcher</code>.
  </p>
