Review all Java source files in this folder and its subfolders recursively. For each class, 
ensure that a Javadoc comment is present for the class declaration and for every public method. 
If any Javadoc is missing, generate clear and accurate Javadoc comments that describe 
the purpose and functionality of the class and its public methods. Preserve existing Javadoc where present, 
and only add or update comments where they are missing or incomplete.

**Important:**
- All classes must have a Javadoc comment.
- All public methods must have Javadoc comments.
- Javadoc should accurately reflect the intent and behavior of the code.
- Do not modify code logic or structure—only add or update Javadoc comments as needed.
