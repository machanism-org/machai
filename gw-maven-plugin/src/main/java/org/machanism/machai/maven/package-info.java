/**
 * Maven plugin goals for generative AI-assisted documentation workflows.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code org.machanism.machai.maven} package contains Maven Mojo implementations that integrate the
 * MachAI document workflow into a Maven build. The goals in this package focus on scanning project
 * documentation, optionally invoking a configured GenAI provider during processing, and cleaning
 * temporary workflow artifacts.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Goals</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code gw}: Scans and processes project documents, optionally using a configured GenAI model.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@code clean}: Removes temporary files created by the document workflow.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Example plugin configuration</h2>
 * <pre>
 * &lt;plugin&gt;
 *   &lt;groupId&gt;org.machanism.machai&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *   &lt;artifactId&gt;gw-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *   &lt;version&gt;${project.version}&lt;/version&gt;
 *   &lt;executions&gt;
 *     &lt;execution&gt;
 *       &lt;goals&gt;
 *         &lt;goal&gt;gw&lt;/goal&gt;
 *         &lt;goal&gt;clean&lt;/goal&gt;
 *       &lt;/goals&gt;
 *     &lt;/execution&gt;
 *   &lt;/executions&gt;
 * &lt;/plugin&gt;
 * </pre>
