# Machai Docs
[@guidance] # (Analyze the source code and generate detailed functional description for the project.)

Machai Docs is centered around the `DocsProcessor`, the main engine for scanning, parsing, and generating documentation throughout Machai-based projects. The processor automatically analyzes project layouts, identifies sources and document resources, and robustly processes files in Markdown, Java, and custom guidance formats.

Key functionalities include:
- **Project scanning**: Detects project structures, divides source and document folders, and traverses files while excluding irrelevant directories.
- **Guidance parsing**: Extracts functional and descriptive guidance marked by `@guidance` tags in source code and documentation, ensuring rule-driven documentation assembly.
- **AI-powered documentation**: Integrates with generative AI models to synthesize clear, concise, and context-aware documentation using project details, source content, and extracted guidance.
- **Format support**: Handles various input formats, including `.md`, `.java`, and custom files, parsing each according to embedded guidance and project context.
- **Extensible and modular**: Built to process multi-module projects, supporting scalable and automated document creation across large codebases.

Machai Docs provides documentation for Machai, a toolkit to simplify and accelerate the assembly of applications. This project gathers guides, references, and resources to help developers leverage Machai and the Machanism ecosystem efficiently.
